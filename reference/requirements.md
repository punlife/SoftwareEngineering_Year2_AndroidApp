Requirements
------------

## Mandatory:

* The app enables the user to do some basic calculations in their head; and then verify the results
* The app has several levels of difficulties
* The app can track the progress of the player
* Data generated from the app must be able to be transferred to a web server when the WIFI Internet connection is available, or becomes available (i.e., if the connection is not available, the app may wait until connectivity is resumed to make the transfer)
* The app uses the sensors from the device, e.g., camera, GPS, gyroscope, or accelerometer. 
* The user must be able to pause, resume and end the app at any point in time, for example due to incoming calls, battery low messages, etc.
* The user must be able to consult a help screen anytime
* The app has useful and appropriate errors messages that guide the user. Informative error messages must, for example, be displayed when there is incomplete or wrong user input. 
* The app can remember the preference settings of the user and other states (e.g., if this is a game, the app must be able to show historical progression of the high score)
* 2 information risks related to the application’s functionality are identified and addressed by the application’s design and/or its implementation
* Choose appropriate licensing terms for the various components of your application
* Properly reference and acknowledge external libraries and resources used
* Identify, in a use case, a customer who could have commissioned the development of your project, and draft reasonable contract terms
* Reflect on at least two of the ethical/social aspects of your project
* List all resources and code used or referred to during project development
* Adhere to a clear and consistent coding style. That will make it easier for yourself, group mates, other groups and supervisors to understand you code.
* The project must be a standard Android SDK project. The project (and its Javadoc documentation) must compile in the SDK when checked out from GIT. The game must compile and run in SDK and the emulator. It must finally run on the provided tablet, currently a Samsung GT-P3110
* Write documentation of the code using Javadoc or similar software
* Use of the concurrent versioning system GIT is compulsory for code and all project documentation. Commit log messages must be significant and useful. (avoid putting binary files on GIT; put them on SurreyLearn)
* Minutes, Agendas and the other documentation must be kept on the GIT server and written in MARKDOWN format.
* 4 project risks are identified 

## Optional:

* The app uses additional services or modules such as web API, QR Code reader, or Google Map
* The app uses Bluetooth to share information between devices
* Identify and mitigate 1 risk related to the privacy of data when stored, displayed or handled locally
* Show evidence that good Information Security practices were put in place (e.g. through the definition of roles and access control rules within the organisation or group, and the appropriate distribution of roles to group members)
* Provide evidence that your project and its delivery comply with its and its dependencies’ licensing terms
* Provide evidence that your development strategy is appropriate for the chosen contract terms
* Justify some of your design, implementation or legal choices in light of these ethical and social aspects
* Outline your organisation or group’s strategy for “giving back” to the relevant development communities. This could take the form of a list of bug reports, patches or pull requests made to upstream libraries, or a reasonable strategy for donations to open source projects you relied on during the development of your application.
