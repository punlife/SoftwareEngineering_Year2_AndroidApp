### Additional Things

- Luminosity and MindMate train your brain to pass the game rather than learning something
- Need to use either:
     - Camera 
	    - Use images that they have taken/uploaded of relatives and then incorporate them into the game - **this may prove difficult**
     - Accelerometer
	 - GPS (did last year)
	    - This came in when people were looking for a doctor in MindMate
- Game ideas
     - Memory games
	 - Colours - limit to four
	 - Miller's law states that if there is a series of something, such as letters, the brain will only remember the last seven
- **Dementia affects short-term memory**
- K.I.S.S
- Can make it more complicated if we so wish, after the basics have been done
