### App Ideas/Details

- One game with increasing difficulties
- Compliment them when they finish a level
- Landscape is a good orientation to work with
- Could start with a card game and depending on how the user is doing, adjust the level accordingly
   - If they are struggling, go down a level
   - If they're doing with, progress to the next level
- Address them directly on the welcome screen
- Potentially have multiple profiles
- Card rotation, hopefully we can do a flip 180 degrees but this takes longer - we shall see how it goes
- Use sqlite to store the local data
- Do as a pop-up window:
   - High score - top 10 and where they are in the leaderboard
   - Ranking could be calculated using the time taken and then multiply by the level they're on?
   - Could show the high scores based on geographical location
   - GPS could get coordinates, determine the country and push onto the database
- Voiceover for the welcome messages and encouragement for the game
- User could be able to customise the colour scheme of the app
   - Light and dark themes
   - Restaurant theme - colourful and positive
      - Comic book type - basic cell shading
