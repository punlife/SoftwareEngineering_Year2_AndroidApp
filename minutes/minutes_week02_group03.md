### App Ideas/Details

- Configuring with Google's style
- Making sure we all follow the same coding conventions (i.e. camel case etc)
- ***Still have to decide if we're going to do one game with lots of different levels, or a whole bunch of games - the documentation allows for leniency and it is still not finalised***
- Save app locally and to the database - if there is no connection, just save the data locally and then transfer to the web database
- The department will provide the database and server access - LOGIN DETAILS EMAILED BY NORMAN, please check your email
- The database has an unlimited number of tables
- Google API included in the Google SDK - don't have to include special libraries
- **Focus on getting the basics of the app done first** and then look at the optional stuff as they may not have extra marks, and as such, won't make much sense to do
- If using sensitive data, need to make them secure when storing them
   - MD5 hash them?
      - Store the hash of the password rather than the password and match the hash when they enter the password
   - Could take a string, hash that, append it to the password, then hash the combination and store that for extra security
   - Could request access to their Gmail account and send the hash key to the remote database

#### Next Meeting: *Thursday 16th Februrary 13:00 in University of Surrey Library*
