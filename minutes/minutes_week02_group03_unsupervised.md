### Additional Things

- Lukasz can find the minutes on the Git repository for this meeting
- Matus has pictures that we can use in our app for free
- Might be easier to use the Amazon database
- GPS and accelerometer are easier to use, camera is harder but we could still do it
- We could use the GPS + camera to show where in the world the users of our app are
- Could have a country/region rating using the GPS/camera
- Can play against other users online
- When we get to coding, we could and should code both individually and together
- **Might be more efficient and guarantee that we finish the app, if we make one game with varying levels of difficulty**

========

### Documentation Clarity
- There are two individual reports that must be completed - one of which is done after every week and the second is done at the end of the project
- The weekly report
   - Writing what you've done that week
   - No more than five lines needed
   - May be used for group scaling
   - "A list of main activities, tasks and assignments untertaken and along with a note on the on the progress or the state associated with each of these activities"
   - "A list of your three most important commits/pushes (if any) to the Git repository with git indentifier and commit description/message"
   - Make a note of what was done in the Thursday lecture that week so that it can be included in the final individual report for skills learnt
   - ***####These must be started this week***
- End of the project report
   - "Individual contribution: What contributions have you made to the group? Put differently, without your contribution, would the project output be similar or slightly worse off than it currently is? And how?"
   - "Self-improvement: What new skill sets have you acquired through this process?"
   - "Process improvement: If you are to participate in another project that is similar to this one, what aspects will you like to change in order to make it better?"


========

### App Ideas/Details

- Akhil: Camera use
   - The camera can be used to take pictures of relatives and instead of using shapes etc. in the game, the pictures of relatives can be used
   - Can either upload or take images
- Matus: Playful app
   - Shop setting
      - The user of the app can work behind the counter in a shop. Customers will come up to them and ask for an order. It is up to the player to remember what the order is, make it and then deliver it to the correct person that ordered it
- Amosh: Right change
   - Similar to the Nintendo Brain Training game where the player has to return the right change
- Victor: Amount of games
   - If we end up doing more than one game, we should not have more than four
- Ryva: Matching
   - Matching card game, like the one in MindMate as a mini-game potentially
