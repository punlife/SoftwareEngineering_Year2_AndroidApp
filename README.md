> I highly recommend [SourceTree by Atlassin](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) as your GIT client. Much more user friendly than command line! To clone a repository, make sure you have generated SSH key in your profile here on gitlab and use HTTPS (not SSH) to clone the repo!

The following needs to be available at beginning of the progress meeting, both in printed form – ensuring that one copy is handed to the project manager – and the original is pushed onto your GIT repository:
* an agenda for the current supervised progress meeting
* minutes of the previous supervised progress meeting
* a report on the previous week’s external lectures (if any)
* the current version of the design document (only weeks 1–5) 

## Unsupervised meetings

**Purpose.** Each group is expected to meet weekly with the aim to discuss and take decisions related to the project, such as distributing and coordinating tasks, evaluating task outcomes, and resolving any technical or managerial issues.

**Meeting time/location.** In order to ensure that meeting arrangements are acceptable to all members, unsupervised meetings are to take place on Campus. You are advised to plan ahead any extracurricular activity. Once a time is agreed, all members are expected to turn up punctually.

Remember that most of you are registered as full-time students and hence ought to be available at standard office hours throughout the week.

**Attendance.** Attendance at the unsupervised meetings is compulsory; and any apologies need to be communicated in advance of the meeting to all group members.

**What to do in each meeting.** In the three hours of weekly unsupervised meeting , group members take turns chairing these meetings, which includes setting the agenda and timekeeping. 

You are supposed to meet up face to face and practice to practice what is normally considered a “daily scrum” session by answering three questions:

* What did you do since the last meeting?
* What will you do today (and onward)?
* Are there any impediments in your way?
