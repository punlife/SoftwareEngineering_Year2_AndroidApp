## Some core information

* The list of all tasks, to-do, in-progress, and who is doing them, is located here [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eyxEYbGuQNy7x1TAffRcrKeDMrAF-x3RHt1ClXFON88/edit#gid=0) If you can think of an item to add, feel free to do so.
* **Upload code only by using GIT! Otherwise you risk breaking the version tracking!**
* SDK API is v21 (Android 5.0) anything below is not compatible with this project!
* Use Log provided by the android API. For the *tag* parameter, use the name of the class. [Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log.html)
* Use Javadoc as a documentation style for the code. [Learn it, use it!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc)
* Use indentation in your code! Don't be silly, use that whitespace.
* Code style needs to be consistent, so:
  * Functions, getters, setters, should start with lower case letter and follow camelCase (example: getModel, setData)
  * Classes should always start with upper case letter and follow camelCase (example: LocalDatabaseManager, RemoteServer)
  * Enums should wlways be UPPER CASE with underscores! (example: TOP_LEFT, TOP_RIGHT, BOTTOM_LEFT, BOTTOM_RIGHT)
  * Inline comments, (comments inside of the function) should be simple and straight and be single line (example: // Begin HTTP request)
  * No unnecessary comments, for example `// Loop cycle` Everyone will understand what `for(...){}` is.
  * Javadoc style documentation for functions
  * Multiple classes that do similar thing should also be named with a similar name (example: UserProfileData, UserProfileScore, UserProfileCurrentGame)
* Requirements set by the module are here: `/reference/requirements.md`
* Requirements for the app are here [Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1enj02S9Xi_geDd5Hp69fTzxsgt3Tzq7drL8lkB60ylA/edit)
* Rota for the supervised meetings can be found here [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W1fBUHdK1AkAna4HDuE0LdCeEDSYRkQjV_MQW8nXU68/edit?usp=sharing)


## Folder Structure
* **agenda** - Weekly agenda markdown files. Use the template agenda_weekxx_group03_template.md to create weekly agendas.
* **assesments** - All assessment forms and feedback, e.g., the interim and final audit forms, should be stored here.
* **design_doc** - Latex source for the design document.
* **final_submission** - Where you store your APK files (where relevant)
* **indi_report** - Invidual report written in Markdown
* **meetings** - Any information discussed on weekly unsupervised meetings. **This is outside of the requirements and the purpose is solely on keeping any references (URLs, ideas, etc...)**
* **minutes** - Markdown text files for the minutes of the meeting. Use the minutes_weekxx_group03_template.md file to create new minutes.
* **reference** - Contains COM2027_Dementia_Ideas.pdf and COM2027_StudentGuide_2016_v2.pdf
* **resources** - Resource files for the android application (sprites, images, logos)
* **src** - Java source code
* **user_acceptance_test** - You will find the installation files of three other groups whose work you will review.

> I highly recommend [SourceTree by Atlassin](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) as your GIT client. Much more user friendly than command line! To clone a repository, make sure you have generated SSH key in your profile here on gitlab and use HTTPS (not SSH) to clone the repo!

The following needs to be available at beginning of the progress meeting, both in printed form – ensuring that one copy is handed to the project manager – and the original is pushed onto your GIT repository:
* an agenda for the current supervised progress meeting
* minutes of the previous supervised progress meeting
* a report on the previous week’s external lectures (if any)
* the current version of the design document (only weeks 1–5) 

## Unsupervised meetings

**Purpose.** Each group is expected to meet weekly with the aim to discuss and take decisions related to the project, such as distributing and coordinating tasks, evaluating task outcomes, and resolving any technical or managerial issues.

**Meeting time/location.** In order to ensure that meeting arrangements are acceptable to all members, unsupervised meetings are to take place on Campus. You are advised to plan ahead any extracurricular activity. Once a time is agreed, all members are expected to turn up punctually.

Remember that most of you are registered as full-time students and hence ought to be available at standard office hours throughout the week.

**Attendance.** Attendance at the unsupervised meetings is compulsory; and any apologies need to be communicated in advance of the meeting to all group members.

**What to do in each meeting.** In the three hours of weekly unsupervised meeting , group members take turns chairing these meetings, which includes setting the agenda and timekeeping. 

You are supposed to meet up face to face and practice to practice what is normally considered a “daily scrum” session by answering three questions:

* What did you do since the last meeting?
* What will you do today (and onward)?
* Are there any impediments in your way?
