Invidual weekly contribution - Victor Artemenco
------------------------------------------

The purpose of this document is to enable each member records his/her weekly contribution to the group. It is meant to be brief, i.e., no more than five lines, and serves as an aide-memoire for you to write your final contribution report, which is formally assessed.

**An individual report should address the following three issues:**

* A list of main activities, tasks and assignments undertaken along with a note on the progress or the state associated with each of these activities;
* A list of your three most important commits/pushes (if any) to the GIT repository with git identifier and commit description/message
